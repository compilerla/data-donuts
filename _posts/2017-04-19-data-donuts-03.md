__From Local Knowledge to Collective Intelligence:__

"What is the value of local knowledge in the age of (big) data? Local knowledge in government work consists of institutional knowledge, informal networks, individual propensities, organizational and community culture. These can be assets to innovation projects. Drawing on my work developing digital literacy and research capacity at DCA, I will illustrate a human-centric knowledge architecture for government agencies and discuss how we can extend the impulse to learn, curiosities about impact, and lines of inquiries from staff, residents and communities."

The County of Los Angeles has thousands of contracts active at any given time, accounting for millions of dollars of the County’s budget.  These contracts are spread out over 30+ departments and cover a variety of services ranging from traffic management systems to emergency child care.  What are the data challenges involved, and what is the County doing to address them?  This presentation will be about one ongoing effort to tackle these issues.

Scoot scoot! Scooter wars rage in LA. Join us next week to find out how a humble data standard can transform cities' capacity to regulate micro-mobility companies. We'll hear from developers and maintainers of the new [Mobility Data Specification (MDS)](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/mobility-data-specification). Theyâ€™ll share how it felt to see their work in [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cities-scooter-data-remix-uber-lyft/) and reveal their hopes and dreams for new streams of mobility data.

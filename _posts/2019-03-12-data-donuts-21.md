In 2017 the [LA County Arts Commission](https://www.lacountyarts.org/) launched the county’s first datathon focused entirely on improving access to the arts, in partnership with the City of LA’s Department of Cultural Affairs. The third annual Arts Datathon takes place on April 2019 and will focus on *democratizing arts data*. Join us to learn how they’re making data more accessible and useful to LA’s vibrant arts and culture communities, and how you can participate. [artsdatathon.org](https://artsdatathon.org/)

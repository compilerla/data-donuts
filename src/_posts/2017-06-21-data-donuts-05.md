#### About Matt Petersen

Matt Petersen was named Chief Sustainability officer by Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles. As the first ever CSO for the City of LA, Matt is focused on helping Mayor Garcetti create 20,000 green jobs in LA, create a more sustainable and livable city and neighborhoods, and hold every city department responsible for cleaner air and water.
<br>

Before joining the Mayorâ€™s office, Matt served as President and CEO of Global Green USA for 19 years. Passionate about improving the lives of those in need, combatting climate change and greening communities, Petersen focused the organization on greening affordable housing, schools and cities (including LA). Petersen led the organization in the green rebuilding of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and later to communities devastated by Hurricane Sandy. Matt is a board member of Global Green USA and Habitat for Humanity of Greater Los Angeles, as well as is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and an advisor to the Clinton Global Initiative.

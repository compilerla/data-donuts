Please join Data + Donuts for our first event in a series about aerial imagery in Los Angeles.

We're thrilled to hear from Javier Aguilar, Senior Regional Planner at Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). Javier will discuss the Regional Aerial Imagery Initiative, a new collaborative project that will enable regional cities, counties, and other stakeholders to pool resources for high-resolution aerial imagery.

This imagery and reference data will be collected in early 2020 and will would provide a critical baseline reference for the 2020 U.S. Decennial Census and the 2024 Regional Transportation Plan and Sustainable Communities Strategy.

As many government agencies are diving into remote work for the very first time, this month Vyki Englert is going to host a crash course in working remote for government agencies. She’ll cover how to author a telework policy, selecting and new configuring tools, and establishing expectations and new cultural norms. Vyki is also authoring [a guide to remote and telework for governments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXtamHd_diCfDfODuIYh2YnfgxnJGpvaMr3vuSwsF-w/edit#heading=h.j0uxv2qq9wt1) full of resources from local, state, and federal agencies and example policies.

California Digital Identity: Piloting Digital Identity with the State of California

The California Department of Technology's Digitial Identity team (CDT D-ID) is tasked with exploring options to provide a consistent, secure, privacy enabled, reliable, and consent-based method to authenticate and verify the identity of a California resident when accessing public services. Join us this month to learn about D-ID's partnership with Login.gov and their agile approach to implementing digital identity with partner agencies to reduce the burden on Californians verifying age to access public benefits.

## Public Transit Ecosystem

MobilityData, a Montreal based nonprofit organization, stewards key transportation data standards – including the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) the de facto standard for representing transit passenger information. Executive Director Eric Plosky will speak about MobilityData’s role in the public transit ecosystem, his vision for the future, and our roles in facing the challenges before us.
